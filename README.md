# Vrv Downloader

It's an app which helps you download videos off VRV.I had only tried to download crunchyroll anime off it,premium anime won't work so does Hidive unless you have a premium account which you could try with the "Requires Premium" box.No gurantees It would work since I don't own a premium account.

Some code isn't that well done since I'm self thought so expect bugs/errors,also report via the Issues if they aries I would try my best to fix.

## Here's a Preview of it
<img src="https://github.com/honghongleong/Vrv-Downloader/blob/master/Preview/Updated%20Preview.jpg?raw=true"/>

## To Do's  
- [x] Dependencies extract showing no progress.
- [x] Ability to save to the same folder instead of selecting save path everytime
- [x] Save in multiple format instead of mp4
- [ ] Download whole series (App instantly download next video after one is done leaving no time for previous video.)
- [ ] Better UI  
- [x] Ability to change themes/background(Not possible due to the images being compiled after build.There maybe other ways to get it work but for now no.)
- [ ] Add proxy support/Geo bypass(Using system wide proxy does work but would be better if it's only app based proxy)

This is a fork of [Crunchyroll Downloader](https://github.com/skid9000/Crunchyroll-Downloader/) but with changes to get it work with vrv.  
Yes,I didn't know to use github last time.
