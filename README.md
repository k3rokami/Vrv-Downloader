# Vrv Downloader

An app to rip videos off VRV, had only tried to download anime off crunchyroll on vrv.Some features may not work as intended(Selecting enUS but downloads in another lang) and there would be bugs while using the application,the appplication would only be maintained when I have the time.  
Features that are not tested/doesn't work:
- Premium
- Hidive

## Here's a Preview of it
<img src="https://github.com/honghongleong/Vrv-Downloader/blob/master/Preview/Updated%20Preview.jpg?raw=true"/>

## Fork  
This is a fork of [Crunchyroll Downloader](https://github.com/skid9000/Crunchyroll-Downloader/) but with minor changes to get it work with vrv.  
Yes,I didn't know to use github last time.  

## To Do's  
- [x] Dependencies extract showing no progress.
- [x] Ability to save to the same folder instead of selecting save path everytime
- [x] Save in multiple format instead of mp4
- [ ] Download whole series (App instantly download next video after one is done leaving no time for previous video.)
- [ ] Better UI  
- [x] Ability to change themes/background(Not possible due to the images being compiled after build.There maybe other ways to get it work but for now no.)
- [ ] Add proxy support/Geo bypass(Using system wide proxy does work but would be better if it's only app based proxy)

## Tools Used
**An account is not required but vpn/proxy is needed if you're outside US.**  
***The programme uses [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).***
