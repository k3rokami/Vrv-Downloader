## Updates would happen when I have the time.
# Vrv Downloader

It's an app which helps you download videos off VRV.Had only tried to download crunchyroll anime off it,premium anime won't work so does Hidive unless you have a premium account which you could try with the "Requires Premium" box.No gurantees It would work since I don't own a premium account.

The original code and ui is based off skid9000's Crunchyroll-Downloader which could be found [Here](https://github.com/skid9000/Crunchyroll-Downloader)

Additional code I've added isn't that well done since I'm self thought so expect bugs/errors,also report via the Issues if they aries I would try my best to fix.

## Here's a Preview of it
